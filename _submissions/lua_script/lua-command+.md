# Description

I share my Command+.
Command+ it's a script for create news command for AC.

You can configure the commands by changing the code directly.

This script adding a few commands :
- player teleport #game_tele           === Teleport selected player to game_tele
- getmodel item | npc | gob #entry     === Return Model of #entry
- getnpc entry | guid | model          === Return Information of Selected NPC
- duplicate item | npc | gob #entry    === Duplicate *_template #entry on DB


In developpment : 
- player set faction #race             === Set player faction for race enter


I still recommend changing the code only if you are sure of what you are doing.

I will not support any changes to the commands in the code.
