## How to install locally (development)

First of all install the [ruby development environment](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) using [this guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

After that install `bundler` using gem and run `bundler install`:
```
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
```

Well, now you can run locally the app using:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

If everything succeds, you can visit your web app at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/modules-catalogue/`.
